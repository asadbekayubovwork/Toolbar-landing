# Features Layer

The Features Layer contains self-contained business features that represent specific functionality in your application. Each feature can include its own components, store, and API logic.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```

│   ├── api/                   # Feature-specific API
│   │   ├── clientApi.ts       # API methods
│   │   └── types.ts           # TypeScript types
│   ├── components/            # Feature components

```

## 🏗 Key Concepts

### 1. Feature Structure

Each feature should be self-contained and include:
- `api/`: API integration
- `components/`: Feature-specific components
- `model/`: Business logic and state management
- `composables/`: Composable functions (optional)
- `index.ts`: Public API

### 2. Public API

Each feature should expose a clean public API through its `index.ts`:

```typescript
// features/clients/index.ts
export * from './api/clientApi'
export * from './model/client.store'
export { default as ClientForm } from './components/ClientForm.vue'
export { default as ClientList } from './components/ClientList.vue'
```

### 3. State Management

Use Pinia for feature state management:

```typescript
// features/clients/model/client.store.ts
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'

export const useClientStore = defineStore('clients', {
  state: () => ({
    clients: [],
    isLoading: false,
    error: null
  }),
  
  actions: {
    async fetchClients() {
      this.isLoading = true
      try {
        const { data } = await clientApi.getClients()
        this.clients = data
      } catch (error) {
        this.error = error
      } finally {
        this.isLoading = false
      }
    }
  },
  
  getters: {
    activeClients: (state) => {
      return state.clients.filter(client => client.status === 'active')
    }
  }
})
```

## 🛠 Best Practices

1. **Feature Isolation**
   - Features should be independent and self-contained
   - Dependencies should flow downward (features can depend on entities and shared)
   - Avoid circular dependencies between features

2. **Component Design**
   - Keep components focused and single-responsibility
   - Use composition API for complex logic
   - Prefer composition functions over mixins

3. **State Management**
   - Use Pinia for feature state
   - Keep state as minimal as possible
   - Use getters for derived state

4. **Testing**
   - Unit test business logic
   - Component test UI components
   - Mock external dependencies

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Pages trigger data loading
   - Features handle API calls and state updates
   - Components react to state changes

2. **User Interactions**
   - Components emit events
   - Features process events and update state
   - UI updates automatically

## 📱 Responsive Design

Feature components should be responsive:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="feature-container">
    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <ClientCard 
        v-for="client in clients" 
        :key="client.id"
        :client="client"
      />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## 🔒 Security

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow least privilege principle
